Quick TODO list

- Extend selection of uncompressed and XIP files to the device table
  mechanism.

- Move XIP blocks out-of-line and batch them together for all files so
  the alignment padding will have to be inserted only once rather than
  for every file.

- Refresh discussion and references about different PAGE_SIZE values.
